# SpinalHDL-CocoTB
SpinalHDL is a high-level HDL based on Scala. CocoTB is a Python-based digital system verification framework.</br>
This repository contains several simple hardware units designed using SpinalHDL and verified using CocoTB for learning purposes. </br>
The goal is to leverage the high level constructs present in SpinalHDL to make hardware design easier and to eventually integrate SpinalHDL-based designs into different FPGA/ASIC flows.</br>
