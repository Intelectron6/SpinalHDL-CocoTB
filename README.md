# SpinalHDL_Experiments
SpinalHDL is a high-level HDL based on Scala. This repository contains some simple hardware units designed using SpinalHDL for learning purposes. </br>
The goal is to leverage the high level constructs present in SpinalHDL to make hardware design easier and to eventually integrate SpinalHDL-based designs into different FPGA/ASIC flows.</br>
